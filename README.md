# desire

Multiple page website converted from .fig to HTML using gulp. For Development I used CSS Preprocessor - SCSS, js und jQuery for Sliders.

Adaptived for all devices. Video PopUps made with @fancyapps/fancybox. Gallery made using mixitup.
You can also click at each item in a blog page to see more information about post and read/write some comments. 

So there is one bug with Gallery, becouse of different size of images in Gallery effect of animation working little wrong.
